# [Shelfie] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [blubyte]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Anagha K] - [NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad]

### Hosted Project Link
[https://shelfie-93cb0.web.app]

### Project Description
[Shelfie is a smart inventory and shopping assistant that helps users:
- Track expiry dates of food, medicines, skincare, and household products
- Scan barcodes to automatically fetch product details
- Receive timely reminders before items expire
- Create an intelligent “To-Buy” list that auto-categorizes items by supermarket sections
By combining barcode scanning, product data APIs, and smart categorization, Shelfie reduces waste, improves safety, and makes shopping more organized and efficient.]

### The Problem statement
[In everyday households, people often forget the expiry dates of food, medicines, and personal care products. This leads to food waste, health risks from expired medicines, and unnecessary repurchases of items already available at home. Additionally, while shopping in supermarkets, unorganized grocery lists cause confusion, repeated walking between sections, and inefficient shopping.
There is a need for a simple, smart system that helps users track product expiry dates and organize shopping more efficiently.]

### The Solution
[By introducing expiry date trackers to track expiry dates efficiently and email notifications before expiry
By providing a basic yet smart 'to buy' list easy to use
Enter an item with least number of clicks maximising user convenience]
